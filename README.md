# Bitcoin Time Series Forecasting Using Prophet Algorithm 

*Jupyter Notebook will be uploaded in next couple of days

In this Project I'll use [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) forecasting algorithm to attempt to forecast Bitcoin's price for the next thrirty days. 

[**Prophet**](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)  is open source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team. The procedure for forecasting time series data is based on an univariate additive model where non-linear trends are fit with `yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects`. It works best with time series that have `strong seasonal effects` and `several seasons` of historical data. Prophet is `robust` to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

[**Bitcoin** **(BTC)**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.
